As per UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/ES-11/1
adopted on 2 March 2022 with 141 votes in favour and 5 votes against,
we attribute the violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,
and subsequent destruction of many Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure,
to large-scale military aggression by the Russian Federation (aided by Belarus).
